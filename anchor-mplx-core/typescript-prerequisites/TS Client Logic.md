# TS Client Logic

## Why Solana Chose TypeScript for Client-Side Development

###  Summary
- Larger talent pool of developers. TypeScript is statically typed and a widely used language. This makes it an easy transition to Solana
- As it's an existing language there is no steep learning curve
- Lots of frameworks available and developers continue to build new frameworks that are easy to integrate
- Client side written in TS means it's easy to differentiate that to what is built onchain
- Good developer experience as there is lots of support
