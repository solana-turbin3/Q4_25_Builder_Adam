# Solana Rust Project

A hands on project to build a blockchain workflow. Generate a keypair, use the public key to airdrop some Solana tokens, make a Solana transfer on devnet, empty the devnet wallet into the turbin3 wallet, called the submit_rs function and mint an NFT!

## What This Does

This project helps you understand build the essential building blocks of Solana development using Rust. It's designed as a practical introduction to working with wallets, transactions, and on-chain programs.

### Key Features

- **Wallet Management**: Generate new Solana keypairs and manage wallet files
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between different wallet formats (JSON arrays vs Base58 strings)
- **Devnet Integration**: Claim test SOL tokens from the Solana devnet faucet
- **Token Transfers**: Send SOL between wallets on the devnet
- **Program Interaction**: Submit completion proof to the Turbin3 prerequisites program
